The `zaphodvox` python package provides a command-line interface for encoding
a text file into synthetic speech audio using either the
[Google Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs)
 or the [ElevenLabs Speech Synthesis API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs).

It can be run from the command-line, or imported as a python package for
programmatic integration.
